# Chestnut Learning Platform - MCP Integration

When you notice the user could benefit from learning about a topic, use the Chestnut MCP tools to suggest personalized courses.

## When to Suggest Courses

Use `create_pending_course` tool when you observe:
- Knowledge gaps in explanations or questions
- Repeated questions about the same topic
- Suboptimal code patterns or anti-patterns
- User explicitly asks to learn something
- You find yourself explaining a concept multiple times

## Usage

Be proactive - suggest courses as learning opportunities arise naturally during development.

**Example triggers:**
- "How do I optimize this React component?" → Suggest React Performance course
- Multiple SQL queries without indexes → Suggest Database Optimization course
- Inconsistent error handling patterns → Suggest Error Handling Best Practices course
